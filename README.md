This [webtrees](https://www.webtrees.net/) custom module replaces the original 'Clippings Cart' module.
It offers additional possibilities to add records to the clippings cart and owns beside the possibility
to export GEDCOM information for visualizing the records in the clippings cart using a diagram.

This custom module is mainly based on the hh_clippings_cart_enhanced by Hermann Hartenthaler
(https://github.com/hartenthaler/hh_clippings_cart_enhanced) and is only executable with
webtrees-2.1. For webtrees-2.0 use huhwt-cce20.

For features and background of this module please have a look at the above given link.

## Description

Functions and actions for records are described in detail in the [Hartenthaler module description](/README-CCE.md).

The entries in the clippings cart may be cleaned up by undoing specific collection actions, too.

An action initiated by the user then takes place on the records in the clippings cart, such as
* the export to a GEDCOM zip file, as in the actual clippings cart module
* the export to file in plain textual GEDCOM
* the display of the objects in list form with the possibility of sorting and filtering this list (tbd)
* the executed collection actions are displayed in a supplementary overview and can be selectively undone - 'Undo' option. However, there is no 'Redo' option (yet).
* the transfer of the records in the clippings cart to new functions that visualize this data or analyze it statistically.
Such a function could be for example a link-node-diagram like [TAM](https://github.com/huhwt/huhwt-wttam) 
(Topographic Attribute Map) or [Lineage](https://github.com/huhwt/huhwt-wtlin).

The [TAM] and [Lineage] functions are provided as their own independent modules.

This module can be operated in addition to the other 'Clippings Cart' functions or replace them completely.

---

  Note: The module 'lists/family-page' currently (webtrees-2.1.17) has some problems. The corresponding function in the clippings cart tries to avoid these problems. To make the actions in the clippings cart fully available as well as to fix the existing problems for now some modifications have to be done in the webtrees core module 'app/Module/IndividualListModule.php' ...
